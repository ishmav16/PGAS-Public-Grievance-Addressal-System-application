# PGAS-Public-Grievance-Addressal-System
  PGAS is a technological solution to the ever growing problems encountered by the urban people everyday. It helps to maintain a transparent relationship among the municipal corporations and the citizens in the urban community. It is an easy way of gathering the problems from the people and resolve them at the earliest by the management authorities.
  
# Working idea is :
  Citizens can lodge their grievances through a smart-phone app. Citizens can monitor the status of the reported problem using a token number generated after reporting a problem. Since the system is a common solution to both citizens and authorities, the authorities can review and resolve the problems reported by the citizens and take responsible actions as per the required situation. The authorities activity is also recorded and this enables to maintain a transparent rapport between citizens and authorities.
